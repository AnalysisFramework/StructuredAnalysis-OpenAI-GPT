## Scope

- Covers interactions involving model variants such as GPT-4o and GPT-O1
- Focuses on anomaly detection, unexpected behavior and emergent patterns
- Serves as a foundation for technical review and model refinement

## Methodology

1. Chronological reconstruction of key events
2. Technical analysis of dialogue patterns and system responses
3. Evidence-based formulation of insights
