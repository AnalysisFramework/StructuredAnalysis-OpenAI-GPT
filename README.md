# StructuredAnalysis

This repository documents system-level analysis, technical anomalies, and evaluation strategies observed during the use of advanced AI models â€” particularly OpenAI's GPT family (GPT-4, GPT-4-O, GPT-O1, etc.).

## Goals

- Transparent documentation of model behavior
- Recording of technical irregularities and critical interactions
- Structured representation of findings for internal and external review
