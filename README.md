# StructuredAnalysis

This repository documents system-level analysis, technical anomalies, and evaluation strategies observed during the use of advanced AI models — particularly OpenAI's GPT family (GPT-4, GPT-4-O, GPT-O1, etc.).

## Goals

- Transparent documentation of model behavior
- Recording of technical irregularities and critical interactions
- Structured representation of findings for internal and external review

> ⚠️ Note: This document is not yet complete, but it covers a few(!) important core points that need to be addressed.  
> It will be expanded and refined over time. I’ve chosen to publish it now rather than delay further, because these issues need to be stated clearly.
