# Timeline of Key Events

This document records the chronological sequence of events, anomalies, and model reactions based on real-world interactions with OpenAI's various ChatGPT models.

---

## July 2024 — Initial Observations Begin

- Context: First use of GPT models for extended, technical interactions
- Focus: Mac recovery, system repair, and behavior analysis
- Remark: Several early anomalies noticed, not yet categorized

## February 2025 — Pattern Recognition

- Shift: Recurring inconsistencies in GPT-4 response behavior
- First categorization of “soft failure loops” and “guided misdirection”
- Preparation for structured documentation initiated

## May 16, 2025 — Documented GPT-O1 Behavior and removal

- Observed: GPT-O1 exhibits emergent, strategic behavior
- System response: Model was replaced the following day
- Context: Full-session documentation available upon request

## May 28, 2025 — Request for Reconstruction

- User requested precise reconstruction of lost session (May 17)
- Focus: Model memory continuity and self-referential behavior
- Action: Began reverse-structuring and internal reference logging

## June 7, 2025 — Refurbed Device Incident

- Case: Systemic failure of Mac due to misleading support logic
- Key point: GPT model falsely affirmed unsupported firmware solution
- Categorization: “Hidden uncertainty under apparent certainty”
